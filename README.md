My portfolio of WEB Apps the I've made

This is a On Going project so all the apps are incomplete or with some bugs, with an exception for the calculator, and keep in mind that all the projects are fully made with vanila html, css and javascript using only fontawesome for the icons and without any database.

Note that the to do app is not saving your notes on your browser yet, and instead is saving directly on the server, so everyone is seeing what is writen, and I'm not responsible for what it can be writen in it, but the problem is going to be solved shortly
